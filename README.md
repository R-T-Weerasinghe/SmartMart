# Smart Mart
A complete ecommerce system designed for a hypothetical supermarket called SmartMart. This app was designed using C# and Visual Studio 2017. 

## Description
This website is about helping tourists to travel in Sri Lanka. It offers a wide range of services specifically designed for tourists. The website features ready-made vacation packages where the entire visit is managed by the travelling company. In addition, should the tourists need to manage the things on their own, they are given the opportunity to select specific tours. Whether they like adrenaline-pumping adventures or soul-healing serene scenaries, this website offers all. Additionally, tourists have the option to see what are the cultural events near to them and how to visit them, if they wish to embrace the cultural heritage in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, tourists can book hotels as well as rent vehicles through this very own site. Tourists can also apply to travel as a group with others which will offer them significant discounts.

This app is a fully-fleged solution to the ecommerce site of the company SmartMart. First and foremost, it offers functionalities to manage the users who can access the system. Different users can be assigned different privileges upon which the app will change its working behaviour. Existing system users can login to the system whereas new users can register to the system with the help of an admin user. Admin users are given separate screens and menus to manage users. Staff users are given access to the inventory control of the supermarket. They can view the current stock and restock if necessary. Customer users can access the system in the same way and they have a virtual cart with a virtual wallet.

> **NOTE:** I am aware that the button colour choices are *really bad*. But this was the first time I ever designed & developed an app. I am a much better developer now who follows the industry standards and guildlines very thoroughly to offer a great UX.
